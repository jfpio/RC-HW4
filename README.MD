### HW4 for RC by Jan Piotrowski

## How to run
1. You need environment with pybullet, scipy and numpy, but I assume that you have it.
2. I use `plt.show()`, but in source code it was `cv2.imshow()`, so you can change it if you want. You need to uncomment code in `__main__`
3. Run `python mapping_agent_task.py` or `python localization_agent_task.py` in terminal.
4. Enjoy!
